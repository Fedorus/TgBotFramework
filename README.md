# TgBotFramework

Make [Telegram.Bot.Framework](https://github.com/TelegramBots/Telegram.Bot.Framework) great again!

# Early state
there is nothing that is guarantied to work, but something definetly works ;)

# Whats new?

This project targets .NET 5.0+ and there won`t be any support for Framework. So keep your stack updated =)

In this implementation you`ll get same pipeline experience as in [Telegram.Bot.Framework](https://github.com/TelegramBots/Telegram.Bot.Framework) but enchanted with:
-[x] Same pipeline processing for Longpolling, Webhook and testing.
-[x] **Stages** (stage and step) to describe user`s state. (yeah, state machine out of the box, at least in plans)
-[x] **Middlewares** - special concept to separate update handling from updateContext configuration.
-[x] **Attributes** and some reflection magic to handle states and command handlers
-[x] **Roles** - it is always needed to separate bot owner from others, right? 
-[ ] **Dashboard** 
-[ ] **DB integration**
-[ ] Better **Logging** (partly implemented)
-[ ] Tested (I wouldn't count on that one ðŸ˜­)
